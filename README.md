# "Breaking Barriers: Empowering Employment Through Deep Learning Solutions for Disabilities"


## <ins>1. Introduction <ins>
In the pursuit of fostering innovation, inclusivity, and positive societal change, the Grand Challenge at USF stands as a beacon of opportunity for students to engage with real-world issues which help solve the unemployment of disabled people. 
###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins> 1.1. Significance of the Mission </ins>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The importance of dismantling barriers to employment for individuals impacted by disability cannot be overstated. As we delve into the intricacies of disability, encompassing physical, social, and institutional dimensions, we confront a stark reality. The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics reports a substantial employment gap, with only 21.3% of people with disabilities employed compared to 65.4% of those without. This disparity is not just a statistical variance; it represents lost opportunities, untapped potential, and unexplored avenues for societal advancement. 
###    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <ins> 1.2. Motivation and initial ideas </ins>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   When considering employment opportunities for individuals with hearing and speech impairments, our focus is on deaf and mute individuals. We have identified three potential occupational domains within this demographic: design, teaching assistance, and handicrafts.
####  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  1.2.1. Design Profession
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deaf and mute individuals can seamlessly transition into the design field, benefitting from AI-assisted training programs that enable them to master project design in a condensed time frame of three months. Moreover, the nature of design work allows for remote engagement, allowing them to sell their projects without necessitating physical relocation.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2.2. Teaching Assistance in Online Environments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evolving landscape of online education presents a viable avenue for deaf and mute individuals to serve as teaching assistants. Through specialized training and AI-supported tools, they can effectively collaborate with instructors in preparing answers, slides, and other instructional materials for online courses. This not only taps into the increasing demand for online learning but also offers a cost-effective alternative to hiring university students.
####  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2.3. Handicraft Production with Ethical Significance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prominent avenue for vocational training lies in the realm of handicraft production. Deaf and mute individuals can be trained to craft souvenirs and gifts, particularly within the context of tourist attractions. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, these handcrafted items can be imbued with ethical significance, fostering a connection with consumers. This niche aligns with the demand for authentic, locally produced goods and serves as a meaningful source of employment.
###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins> 1.3. Our ideas and products </ins>

###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     <ins> 2.1. Understanding the Barriers: </ins>
####  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                       2.1.1. Physical Barriers: 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                    Deaf and mute individuals often encounter physical impediments that limit their access to employment opportunities. Architectural structures, such as spaces without adequate visual signalling or communication aids, pose substantial challenges. 
####  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                     2.1.2. Social Barriers: 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                     The social barriers faced by individuals with deafness and mutism are deeply rooted in misconceptions and stereotypes. Negative attitudes such as depression, lack of awareness, and the absence of accommodations contribute to a hostile social environment that can be isolating. 
####  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                      2.1.3. Institutional Barriers: 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                      Institutional policies and practices can unintentionally perpetuate the challenges faced by deaf and mute individuals in the workforce. Employment processes that do not account for alternative forms of communication or lack inclusive hiring policies may inadvertently exclude qualified individuals. 
###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <ins> 2.2. Connection Between Barriers and Social Entrepreneurship: </ins>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Addressing the employment barriers faced by deaf and mute individuals requires an innovative approach. 
####  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.1. Innovative Communication Solutions:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Barrier: Traditional workplace communication may pose challenges for deaf and mute individuals.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Social Entrepreneurial Response: Howde networking.
####  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.2. Inclusive Employment Models And Educational Initiatives:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Barrier: Employment structures often need more inclusivity and need to accommodate diverse needs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Social Entrepreneurial Response: Design inclusive employment models that actively engage and empower deaf and mute individuals, focused on providing employment opportunities. Skills development programs: Focusing on building Howde building resume function (which includes suggesting courses and training boot camps to train the user to become a designer, a handicraft or an online teaching assistant) and Howde job recommender system (the data is built only for deaf and mute). 
####  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.3. Advocacy for Inclusive Policies:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Barrier: Institutional policies may not sufficiently address the needs of deaf and mute individuals.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Social Entrepreneurial Response: Engage in advocacy efforts to influence policy changes at the institutional level to ensure that policies are inclusive and supportive of the employment needs of the deaf and mute community.
####  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.4. Community-Centric Support Systems:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barrier: Limited support systems for the deaf and mute community within the workplace.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social Entrepreneurial Response: Establish community-centric support systems through social enterprises focused on mentorship, counselling, and workplace integration programs through Howde networking.
In conclusion, the principles of social entrepreneurship provide a powerful framework for addressing the barriers to employment for deaf and mute individuals. Through innovation, inclusivity, and a commitment to positive social impact, social entrepreneurship catalyzes for transformative change, fostering a future where employment opportunities are genuinely accessible.

## <ins> 4.  IDEAL OUTCOME </ins> 
By competing in the Grand Challenges, we hope our project will be able to reach out to those investors. We believe that our project can help solve the unemployment of disabled people nowadays. Moreover, This is a competition where we could find out more ideas which can develop ours better. It is also a competition where we can test whether our ideal and technology would be suitable before considering making it real. This project is likely to be charitable work rather than a profitable project. Therefore, through the Grand Challenge, we hope this idea can soon be a solution to those problems.
