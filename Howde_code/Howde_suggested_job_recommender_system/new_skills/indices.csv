"GlaxoSmithKline is one of the world's leading pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, with statisticians and programmers working at UK and US R&D sites, and worldwide. In recognition of the developing sophistication and technical requirements of the programming role, the Clinical Programming department was formed as a standalone department within the broader Clinical Statistics group 18 months ago, covering all phases of clinical drug development and commercialization in a wide range of therapeutic areas. In addition to the group's activities supporting GSK's pipeline of drugs, key accountabilities include driving CDISC implementation for the reporting of clinical trials, and identifying and implementing technology solutions to offer further benefit and efficiency for the group's activities.",22234
